# twython-streamer-project
Uses Twython to stream tweets with particular hashtags or usernames. Use the Raspberry Pi Sense Hat to display an image.
See picture. Previous iterations used a breadboard and LEDs, different colors for different hastags or usernames. 

You will need to check out the Raspberry Pi "Getting Started with the Twitter API" education resource to see how to set up the
file that contains the various tokens that allow you to stream tweets. 
Cheers.
